The AD Privacy Layer provides a personal crypto advertising preference (PCAP) document attached to userDID, which contains user advertising privacy management service. The PCAP document works not only forpayment but also for user preference data. The preserved data can be used but can not be seen.

The decentralized oracle is designed for collecting data from conventional Internet. It is built as part of Substrate Offchain Worker(OCW) and particularly works for Ad verification with low fee and fast response.
